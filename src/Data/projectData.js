      "My hash checking program is designed to verify downloads. It works by inputting the hash given from the source of the file, as well as the location of the file and type of algorithm used. With this information, the program creates a hash of the file and tells the user whether it is safe to use or not. Many other programs will do the same job however I found it handy to have a version I designed that I can change over time to meet my own needs. I plan to eventually add a system that will automatically detect what algorithm is being used by the length or a system where more than one algorithm can be tested at the same time.",

      "I created this project as a tool that will be used for a future project, the enigma machine. It will be used to translate the letters into morse to be sent to other machines. It can encode and decode morse code using an array to store the morse code for each letter in the position of its ASCII character. As well as this it is my first attempt at using audio within a C# program. It is used to play the audio sounds for the morse code. The program also has a copy to clipboard function.",

    description:
      "HashCrash is a password cracking tool I produced as I found many existing services yielded unreliable results when recently installed on new machines unless the exact configuration was preserved often errors occurred. This program circumvents this by using a simple approach; the only file it requires is a list of possible passwords. Using this list it performs a dictionary attack against the hash provided by the user. This Attack works by reading the dictionary list line-by-line and performing a hash on each entry until the hash matches the one provided by the user. The program can determine which hashing function is being used by the length of the has provided.",

      "This project was a result of my A-Level Computer Science coursework. The task was to make a database management system using Visual Basic.NET to create an interface on the .NET framework with SQL as the communication language from the interface to the database. I was made to make the system for a specific client so I made this system for a long-term caravan storage park. The database has three tables with relationships connecting them, as well as another table used to save login information for the system. If I ever planned to return to this project I would encrypt the login system and provide better data protection for the data stored in the database.",
