It works by inputting the hash given from the source of the file, as well as the location of the file and type of algorithm used. With this information, the program creates a hash of the file and tells the user whether it is safe to use or not. There are many other programs that will do the same job however I found it handy to have a version I designed that I can change over time to meet my own needs. My plan is to eventually add a system that will automatically detect what algorithm is being used by the length or a system where more than one algorithm can be tested at the same time.",primiaryLanguage:"C#"},{projectName:"JavaScript Utilities",repoLink:"https://github.com/MatthewNobes/JS-Utilities",pagesLink:"https://matthewnobes.github.io/JS-Utilities/",description:"A collection of different functions and algorithms.

This program circumvents this by using a simple approach; the only file it requires is a list of possible passwords. Using this list it performs a dictionary attack against the hash provided by the user. This Attack works by reading the dictionary list line-by-line and performing a hash on each entry until the hash matches the one provided by the user.
