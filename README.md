# Matthew Nobes 

This is my new personal website. I have decided to create this new version in React to provide a better user experience, and demonstrate my React skills.

# Available Scripts

The scripts for this program can be found here:

## `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\

## `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

## `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Other scripts

There are more scripts available, for more information on these, look at the documentation for create-react-app.

# Notes

This React version is still in development. It is unknown when this version will be complete.
