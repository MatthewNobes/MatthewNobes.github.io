        <p>I have been programming since 2013 and in this time I've produced a varity of coding projects  I have experiance with a wide varity of programming languages including </p>

        <p>I have decided not to include all the projects I have made due to the fact that some of these contain sensative informaion I do not wish to make public.</p>

        <h2>Project Examples</h2>
          <h3>Hash Checker</h3>
          <p>My hash checking program is designed to verify downloads. It works by inputing the hash given from the source of the file, as well as the location of the file and type of algorithm used. With this information the program creates a hash of the file and tells the user wheather it is safe to use or not.There is many other programs that will do the same job however I found it handy to have a version I designed that I can chnage over time to meet my own needs. My plan is to eventually add a system that will automatically detect what algorithm is being used by the length or a system where more than one algorithm can be tested at the same time.

          <h3>Pizza Ordering System</h3>
          <p>This program was made as a piece of coursework as part of my first year at Portsmouth university for an introdcutory programming unit, used to test students Java ability and use of classes. The program is designed to complet three tasks. The first is to the program itself complets a basic task but uses more advanced programming concepts to make it more efficent than if written without using classes.
