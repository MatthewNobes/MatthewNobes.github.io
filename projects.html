        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>I have been programming since 2013 and in this time I've produced a varity of coding projects.  I have experiance with a wide varity of programming and markup languages including: </p>
        <ul class="inTextList">
          <li>C#</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>Java</li>
          <li>Python</li>
          <li>SQL</li>
        </ul>
        <P>I am also currently learning JavaScript inorder to improve this website and gain additonal web developemnt skills.</p>
        <p>Many examples of my projects can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/MatthewNobes" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. I have not to included all the projects I have made due to the fact that some of these contain sensative informaion I do not wish to make public.</p>

        <h2>Project Examples</h2>
          <h3>Hash Checker</h3>
          <p>My hash checking program is designed to verify downloads. It works by inputing the hash given from the source of the file, as well as the location of the file and type of algorithm used. With this information the program creates a hash of the file and tells the user wheather it is safe to use or not.There is many other programs that will do the same job however I found it handy to have a version I designed that I can chnage over time to meet my own needs. My plan is to eventually add a system that will automatically detect what algorithm is being used by the length or a system where more than one algorithm can be tested at the same time.

          <h3>Pizza Ordering System</h3>
          <p>This program was made as a piece of coursework as part of my first year at Portsmouth university for an introdcutory programming unit, used to test students Java ability and use of classes. The program is designed to complet three tasks. The first is to the program itself complets a basic task but uses more advanced programming concepts to make it more efficent than if written without using classes.

          <h3>Calculator</h3>
          <p>I made this project when I was first learning C# and it serves as a simple calaculator application for windows based operating systems. I made it to learn the basic syntax however I oftern find it nicer to use than the current default calculator for windows 10, and I can customise it at any time I want to fit ever changing needs.

          <h3>Caravan Storage Database Management Program</h3>
          <p>This project was a result of my A Level Computer Science coursework. The task was to make a database management system using Visual Basic.NET to create an interface on the .NET framework with SQL as the communication lanaguage from the interface to the database. I was made to make the system for a specific client so I made this system for a long-term caravan storage park. THe database has three tables with relationships connecting them, as well as another table used to save login informaion for the system. If I ever planned to return to this project I would encrypt the login system and provide better data protection for the data stored in the database.

          <h3>Personal Portfolio Website</h3>
          <p>The website your currenyl viewing is hosted using GitHub pages, therefor I have made the reposiotry for it publicly available to view. I made this site inorder to showcase my projects, as well as a place to store and access my help guides.

          <h3>Morse Code Translator</h3>
          <p>I created this project as a tool that will used for a future project, the enigma mahcine. It will be used to translate the letters into morse to be sent to other machines. It has the capability to encode and decode morse code using an array to store the morse code for each letter in the position of its ASCII character. As well as this it is my first attempt at using audio within a C# program. It is used to play the audio sounds for the morse code. The program also has a copy to clipboard function.

          <h3>HashCrash</h3>
          <p>HashCrash is a password cracking tool I produced as I found many existing services yielded unreliable results when recently installed on new machines, unless the exact configuration was preserved often errors occurred. This program circumvents this by using a simple approach; the only file it requires is a list of possible passwords. Using this list it performs a dictionary attack against the hash provided by the user. This Attack works by reading the dictionary list line-by-line and performing a hash on each entry until the hash matches the one provided by the user. The program can determine which hashing function is being used by the length of the has provided.
