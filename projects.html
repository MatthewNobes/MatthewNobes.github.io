        <P>I am also currently learning JavaScript inorder to improve this website and gain additonal web developemnt skills.</p>
        <p>Many examples of my projects can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/MatthewNobes" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
        <p>I have not to included all the projects I have made due to the fact that some of these contain sensative informaion I do not wish to make public.</p>

        <h2>Project Examples</h2>
          <h3>Hash Checker</h3>
          <p>My hash checking program is designed to verify downloads. It works by inputing the hash given from the source of the file, as well as the location of the file and type of algorithm used. With this information the program creates a hash of the file and tells the user wheather it is safe to use or not.There is many other programs that will do the same job however I found it handy to have a version I designed that I can chnage over time to meet my own needs. My plan is to eventually add a system that will automatically detect what algorithm is being used by the length or a system where more than one algorithm can be tested at the same time.

          <h3>Pizza Ordering System</h3>
          <p>This program was made as a piece of coursework as part of my first year at Portsmouth university for an introdcutory programming unit, used to test students Java ability and use of classes. The program is designed to complet three tasks. The first is to the program itself complets a basic task but uses more advanced programming concepts to make it more efficent than if written without using classes.

          <h3>Calculator</h3>
          <p>I made this project when I was first learning C# and it serves as a simple calaculator application for windows based operating systems. I made it to learn the basic syntax however I oftern find it nicer to use than the current default calculator for windows 10, and I can customise it at any time I want to fit ever changing needs.
